1: What is a Shell? 

A shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services. 
Shell accepts human-readable commands from users and converts them into something which the kernel can understand. 
It is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. 
The shell gets started when the user logs in or starts the terminal.

Shell is broadly classified into two categories â€“

Command Line Shell
Graphical shell

In the 1970s an 1980s, command line input was commonly used by Unix systems and PC systems like MS-DOS and Apple DOS.
