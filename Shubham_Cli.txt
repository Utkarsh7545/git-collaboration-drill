1. What Is a Shell?
    * The shell is a user program or it is an environment provided for user interaction.
    * It is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input device such as a keyboard or from a file.
    * The shell gets started when you log in or open a console (terminal).
    * Quick and dirty way to execute utilities.
    * The shell is not part of the system kernel but uses the system kernel to execute programs, create files, etc.

    Example: $ cat /etc/shells
                # /etc/shells: valid login shells
                /bin/sh
                /usr/bin/sh
                /bin/bash
                /usr/bin/bash
                /bin/rbash
                /usr/bin/rbash
                /usr/bin/dash
2. Command Line Input

    * CLI is a command line program that accepts text input to execute operating system functions.

    * Today, with graphical user interfaces (GUI), most users never use command-line interfaces (CLI).

    * CLI is still used by software developers and system administrators to configure computers, install software, and access features that are not available in the graphical interface.

    Example: shubham@shubham-Lenovo-ideapad-320-15ISK:~$ help
                GNU bash, version 5.2.21(1)-release (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu)
                These shell commands are defined internally.  Type `help' to see this list.
                Type `help name' to find out more about the function `name'.
                Use `info bash' to find out more about the shell in general.
                Use `man -k' or `info' to find out more about commands not in this list.

                A star (*) next to a name means that the command is disabled.

                job_spec [&]                            history [-c] [-d offset] [n] or hist>
                (( expression ))                        if COMMANDS; then COMMANDS; [ elif C>
                . filename [arguments]                  jobs [-lnprs] [jobspec ...] or jobs >
