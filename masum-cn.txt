1. What is a Computer Network?

A computer network is a system that connects two or more computing devices for transmitting and sharing information. 
Computing devices include everything from a mobile phone to a server. 
These devices are connected using physical wires such as fiber optics, but they can also be wireless.

2. What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that share resources and information.
These devices can include computers, servers, printers, and other hardware. Networks allow for the efficient exchange of data, enabling various applications such as email, file sharing, and internet browsing.

3. How Does a Computer Network Work?
Basics building blocks of a Computer network are Nodes and Links. A Network Node can be illustrated as Equipment for Data Communication like a Modem, Router, etc., or Equipment of a Data Terminal like connecting two computers or more.
Link in Computer Networks can be defined as wires or cables or free space of wireless networks.
The working of Computer Networks can be simply defined as rules or protocols which help in sending and receiving data via the links which allow Computer networks to communicate.
Each device has an IP Address, that helps in identifying a device.

4. Basic Terminologies of Computer Networks
Network: A network is a collection of computers and devices that are connected together to enable communication and data exchange.
Nodes: Nodes are devices that are connected to a network. These can include computers, Servers, Printers, Routers, Switches, and other devices.
Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted over a network. Examples of protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.

5. Types of Enterprise Computer Networks
LAN: A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that covers a small area, such as an office or a home. LANs are typically used to connect computers and other devices within a building or a campus.
WAN: A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a network that covers a large geographic area, such as a city, country, or even the entire world. WANs are used to connect LANs together and are typically used for long-distance communication.
Cloud Networks: Cloud Networks can be visualized with a Wide Area Network (WAN) as they can be hosted on public or private cloud service providers and cloud networks are available if there is a demand. Cloud Networks consist of Virtual Routers, Firewalls, etc.

6 . Cloud Networking -> Public Cloud: Services offered over the public Internet, available to anyone who wants to purchase them.
                        Private Cloud: A cloud environment dedicated to a single organization.
                        Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
