Introduction to Computer Networks:

A computer network is defined as a collection of linked devices, such as servers and PCs, that have the ability to exchange data and operate together.

Network Types:

LANs (Local Area Networks): These networks span a constrained geographic area, such as a single campus or building.

Wide Area Networks, or WANs, link several local area networks (LANs) over broad geographic regions.

A metropolis or sizable campus is covered by a MAN (Metropolitan Area Network).

Personal area network, or PAN, is a small network used by individual devices, such as Bluetooth connections.

Intranet: A private network used mostly for internal communication that is only available to members of an organization.

Extranet: An intranet to which external users have restricted access.

Topologies of networks:

Bus: A single, central cable to which all gadgets are connected.
Star: Every gadget is linked to a single hub or switch.
Ring: Data flows in a single direction between devices connected in a circle.
Mesh: Every gadget is linked to every other gadget.
A hybrid system combines two or more topologies.

Network protocols are guidelines for exchanging data. HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and TCP/IP are a few examples.

The OSI Model is a conceptual framework that explains network communication through seven layers: physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application.

Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application layers make up the TCP/IP Model, a four-layer model that is used to develop and implement network protocols.

Every device on a network has an IP address, which is a unique address that is used to identify and connect with the device.

MAC Address: A network interface card's (NIC) specific identification number for data link layer communication.

Subnetting is the process of creating smaller, easier-to-manage subnetworks (subnets) out of a larger network.

Finding the route that data travels over a network to get from its source to its destination is known as routing.
